# Beta-Regression-with-L1-penalty
This project is to achieve Beta Regression with L1 penalty. The algorithm of beta_L1.py is based on the result of Niloofar Ramezani, Martin Slawski, which can be found on https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20079, which is more suitable for large datasets with high dimension. For beta with L1.py, the program is more time consuming but the idea is more simple and easy for understanding. 

Attention please! For the beta regression the response must in the interval of (0,1), and this condition is really strictly only in the program but also in the theorical part, because if the condition is not satisfied it means the function doesn't satisfy the Lipschitz continuity, then the series will be divergence and in the program the looping part will fail convergence. So before using the function to fit the model, check whether the responses contain values that are exactly 0 or 1ÔºÅ
